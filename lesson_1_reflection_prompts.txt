How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps because it compares the versions together and indicates the changes 
    with a + or - 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Because it is possible to track the progress and if errors happen you can
	find them easyer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With Git you can choose which and when a version is saved. Google docs 
    saves every version even if you don't want to save a version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make it easier to work in a group on a project and to trak the changes. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First use git log to find the commit you want to compare. Then push q and tip
    git diff with the two commit ID's you want to compare.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you know you can get your previous verson back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To save and make different versions of my projects.
