When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	If it is not possible to use my local computer or if I use a different computer
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  

	Not every change is necessary to be tracked to progress with the project.
