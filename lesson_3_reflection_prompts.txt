When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	If it is not possible to use my local computer or if I use a different computer
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  

	Not every change is necessary to be tracked to progress with the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks and clones are quiet similar. Forks clones from a GitHub profile to
	your GitHub profile and refers to the original origin of the code. Clones 
	download the repositories of a projet to the computer. Whereas branches 
	make only a different version of your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It is wasyer to track the changes and to merge.
